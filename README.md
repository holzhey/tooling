# Tooling

I decided to track the tools i like/use here, so others can check them out!
I am big fan of Rust, so most tools will be developed on that language.

## Fish shell

I was using Zsh for a long time and using plugins for themes, autocomplete, suggestions, etc.
Fish is so far the best shell i used and still using. It has all the features i was looking, but native, no more plugins.

[Official Site](https://fishshell.com/)

## LSDeluxe

I know, ls command is very powerfull and you probably have everything you need.
But i found LSDeluxe a much better look, which make easier for my eyes to understand what i see.

[GitHub](https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd)

## Yazi

From the old times of Norton Commander on MSDOS, i really like TUI applications.
Yazi is a powerfull terminal file manager, where you can copy, rename, move files around.

[GitHub](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi)
[Official Site](https://yazi-rs.github.io/)

## Helix editor

About one year ago i was solely an IDE based developer, using vi/vim just for some basic file manipulation when necessary.
Then i decided to try neovim and i was fascinated by its ecosytem and usability, specially regarding the LSP funcitions (learn once, apply to all).
Finally, i found Helix. It's concept is a bit different, but is much more faster specially for LSP and it support a lot of languages.

[GitHub](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix)
[Official Site](https://helix-editor.com/)

## NeoVim

But NeoVim is great and sometimes i use it specially when working on some file type which the LSP is missing on Helix, like CloudFormation templates.

### LazyVim

You can get started with NeoVim by using LazyVim: the name says all!

[GitHUb](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)
[Official Site](https://www.lazyvim.org/)

### Nvchad

This is also pretty nice to get started with NeoVim, much cleaner from start so you will have to configure it yourself.
In my opinion it is faster than using LazyVim, probably because all the missing plugins... which is a great thing from LazyVim as you have a lot of
good plugins selection + configuration working smoothly from scratch.

## Tailspin

Wanna see your logs better, like what LSDeluxe does for listing files?
Then this tool is for you: it is a simple log highlighter, making all easier to catch.

[GitHub](https://github.com/bensadeh/tailspin)

## Disk Usage Analyzer

Sometimes is not easier to clearly see/find where you are wasting space.
This tool is a visual approach to do that!

[GitHub](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli)

## s3sync

Some time ago i wanted to check some emails that AWS SES put on a S3 bucket, but it is a bit diffcult to download all of them.
This tool sync everything you have in a S3 bucket into your local filesystem.

[GitHub](https://github.com/nidor1998/s3sync)

## Bat

You know cat, to dump file content? You should try bat instead!
Once again, a tool that makes better for my eyes to understand what i see.

[GitHub](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)

## vhs

Nice approach to share some terminal action into GIF files, so you can add it to another static document like tutorials, html, etc.

[GitHub](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs)

## csvlens

I was using Visual Studio with a plugin to view CSV files nicely.
Forget about! CSVLENS is much better and faster, of course!

[GitHub](https://github.com/YS-L/csvlens)

## Hexyl

Simply a binary file viewer.

[GitHub](https://github.com/sharkdp/hexyl)

## viu

I really like teh terminal environment, you can even open images!

[GitHub](https://github.com/atanunq/viu)

## Delta

Git diffs are nice, but to me this one make it better.

[GitHub](https://github.com/dandavison/delta)

## Just

Forget about Makefiles!!

[GitHub](https://github.com/casey/just)

## Papeer

Grab a website and save it as a PUB or Markdown file.

## Jql

Yeah, jq by Rust!! They are not the same! ;-) 

[GitHub](https://github.com/yamafaktory/jql)

## Dust

Another way to check your disk usage.

[GitHub](https://github.com/bootandy/dust)

## Interactive rebase

It is ok to use vi to edit my git rebases, but with this tool it is very easy and less prone to errors!

[GitHub](https://github.com/MitMaro/git-interactive-rebase-tool)

## tuime

Yeah, sometimes i just wanted a nice clock in my terminal while i am thinking about something else...

[GitHub](https://github.com/nate-sys/tuime)

## mpv

Play videos in your terminal!

[GitHub](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv)

## yt-dlp

You never know if that video you really like will be removed from the internet.
I personally like to keep them!

[GitHub](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

## russ

Stay up to date with RSS feeds!

[GitHub](https://github.com/ckampfe/russ)

## Bottom

Clone of top, htop, etc.
I find it cleaner to see overall usage. And you can go into details if you need to.

[GitHub](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom)

## MailHog

This allows to send emails locally for quick tests during development.
Basically a local mail server with an web UI.

[GitHub](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog)

## Catppuccin

Common, i shared a lot of tools with great and colorful output.
So let me share the theme i use everywhere!

[GitHub](https://github.com/catppuccin)

## HTTPie

I find Postman too complex and Insomnia now requires a login.
So to test my APIs i use HTTPie Desktop.

[GitHub](https://github.com/httpie)
[Official Site](https://httpie.io/)

## GitUI

I really like to use git at CLI. I think that by using graphical UI will make me unaware of what i am doing.
But sometimes is good to have a helper to quickly navigate between commits and diffs, this is where i use GitUI!

[GitHub](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui)

## jnv

Interactive json viewer with highlighting and jq filtering.

[GitHub](https://github.com/ynqa/jnv)

## Rain

Tool to deploy, delete and check AWS CLoudFormation templates and stacks.
Yes, AWS CLI does the same, but once again the UX here is better.

[GitHub](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/rain)

## Alacritty

I was using iTerm2 for a long time, then i found this OpenGL accelerated terminal.
It is pretty fast, configurable, i did not struggle to configure and use the mouse and keyboard in my Mac,
plus it is cross-platform so it will survive the day i move to [System76](https://system76.com/) machines with a Linux based distro!
Edit: i still like it, but after trying it a bit more i found out that there is no tab support, so let's back to iTerm for now.

[GitHub](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
[Official Site](https://alacritty.org/)

## Zellij

After my move to Alacritty, i also decided to use a new approach for managing my tabs, not relying in Iterm2 anymore.
This one it awesome! Very easy to get used plus very configurable and extendable.

[GitHub](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij)
[Official Site](https://zellij.dev)

## Rust Search extension

For both Firefox and Chrome, a search tool for Rust documentation.

## Tom - Terminal for Open-Meteo

Pretty cool to check out the weather conditions on your CLI, based on Open-Meteo.

[GitHub](https://github.com/mlange-42/tom)

## Git-Graph

Simple but nice tool to view your git history in a graph.

[GitHub](https://github.com/mlange-42/git-graph)

## Exa

LS Deluxe is really cool, but i discovered Exa! It has similar features, but is faster, more configurable and provides Git information.

[GitHub](https://github.com/ogham/exa)
[Official Site](https://the.exa.website/)

## Cargo-Machete

Check whenever you have unused dependencies in your Rust project, both locally or in a GitHub action.

[GitHuh](https://github.com/bnjbvr/cargo-machete)

## WezTerm

This terminal emulator (and multiplexer) fits much better my profile than iTerm2 and other terminals. It is developed in Rust and have all the features that i need.
It supports tabs, you can split it into multiples panes, navigate and resize them very easily. You can also select and copy content using only your keyboard.

[GitHub](https://github.com/wez/wezterm)
[Official Site](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)

## Cyme

Another TUI project to listing USB devices using your terminal, similar to `lsusb`. With plenty of options, you can adjust the output as required (i use it for Arduino development).

[GitHub](https://github.com/tuna-f1sh/cyme)

## Pik

Sometimes, you just need to kill some process. I fetch the PID and kill it, but now we have Pik!

[GitHub](https://github.com/jacek-kurlit/pik)
[Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/pik)

## Pls

Yet another `ls` replacement! This one has a deep level of detailed information and it is completely configurable.

[Official Site](https://pls.cli.rs/)

## Epoch

Simples but useful tool to convert epoch data on CLI.

Really nice CSV tool to quickly navigate into a CSV file, plus with a lot of manupulation features including an expression language for querying!
[GitHub](https://github.com/medialab/xan)

## DDV

DynamoDB browser for CLI! Besides it is not intended (yet?!) for large tables, it is a good tool for navigating DDB tables easily.
[GitHub](https://github.com/lusingander/ddv)
[Official Site](https://lusingander.github.io/ddv/)

## JLess

Practical and nice JSON viewer for CLI.
[GitHub](https://github.com/PaulJuliusMartinez/jless)

[GitHub](https://github.com/Canop/bacon)
[Official Site](https://dystroy.org/bacon/)
<<<<<<< HEAD

## Ghostty

WezTerm is great, but i give a try to Ghostty and it is more integrated with MacOS: better key shortcuts, copy & paste experience and fast. I don't use Lua scripting and i really like very fast response, which is a big thing on Ghostty as well.
[GitHub](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty)
[Official Site](https://ghostty.org/)

## Sniffnet

Finally a great and user friendly tool to inspect network traffic! With a great GUI i could easily inspect overall traffic. Maybe not a deep technical tool, with plenty of details and options, but for sure the easiest to inspect traffic at a high level.
[GitHub](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet)
[Official Site](https://sniffnet.net/)

## Tide

Fish is a awesome shell but with Tide it become even better. Tide is prompt for Fish shell that simplify it, providing useful information at fast speed.
[GitHub](https://github.com/IlanCosman/tide)

## Envx

System environment variables viewer and manager.
[GitHub](https://github.com/mikeleppane/envx)

## Mise (mise-en-place)

"Development tools management" as they said, i use it to manage multiple versions of Python and Node. It is much easier and effective than dealing with my previous approach with Homebrew and PATH configuration.
