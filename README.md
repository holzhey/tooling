# Tooling

I decided to track the tools i like/use here, so others can check them out!
I am big fan of Rust, so most tools will be developed on that language.

## Fish shell

I was using Zsh for a long time and using plugins for themes, autocomplete, suggestions, etc.
Fish is so far the best shell i used and still using. It has all the features i was looking, but native, no more plugins.

## LSDeluxe

I know, ls command is very powerfull and you probably have everything you need.
But i found LSDeluxe a much better look, which make easier for my eyes to understand what i see.

## Yazi

From the old times of Norton Commander on MSDOS, i really like TUI applications.
Yazi is a powerfull terminal file manager, where you can copy, rename, move files around.

## Helix editor

About one year ago i was solely an IDE developer, using vi/vim just for some basic file manipulation when necessary.
Then i decided to try neovim and i was fascinated by its ecosytem and usability, specially regarding the LSP funcitions (learn once, apply to all).
Finally, i found Helix. It's concept is a bit different, but is much more faster specially for LSP and it support a lot of languages.

## Tailspin

Wanna see your logs better, like what LSDeluxe does for listing files?
Then this tool is for you: it is a simple log highlighter, making all easier to catch.

## Disk Usage Analyzer

Sometimes is not easier to clearly see/find where you are wasting space.
This tool is a visual approach to do that!

## s3sync

Some time ago i wanted to check some emails that AWS SES put on a S3 bucket, but it is a bit diffcult to download all of them.
This tool sync everything you have in a S3 bucket into your local filesystem.

## Bat

You know cat, to dump file content? You should try bat instead!
Once again, a tool that makes better for my eyes to understand what i see.

## vhs

Nice approach to share some terminal action into GIF files, so you can add it to another static document like tutorials, html, etc.

## csvlens

I was using Visual Studio with a plugin to view CSV files nicely.
Forget about! CSVLENS is much better and faster, of course!

## Hexyl

Simply a binary file viewer.
